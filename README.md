# Interactive-Form-TT-3
This is the third project for the FSJS Tech Degree, An interactive form. The HTML and CSS was already provided by Team Treehouse. My assigment was to 
add interactivity to the form. 


## Real-time error message:
I created both the name and email field to show a real time error as soon as 1 letter is typed. 
the email feild automatically goes green when the email address is typed correctly. 

But both feilds will be validated when the submit button is click incase they never actually type anything in. 

## Conditional error message 
I created the email feild to check for a blank string and alert "Field cannot be empty" 
and I also have it checked the email is properly formatted and alert "Email address must be formatted correctly" if it is submited wrong.
